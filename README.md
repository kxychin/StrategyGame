# Strategy Game Web Application
This project is about strategy gaming data transforms into actionable insights! In this venture, I dived into a vast strategy games dataset, employing Python to meticulously normalize the data. This critical step ensured an organized, efficient, and scalable foundation for our project.

Following normalization, I forged an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to conceptualize and map the relationships within the data. This model became the blueprint for our SQL database, serving as a guide to structuring and importing the normalized dataset effectively.

Subsequently, utilizing SQL queries, I embarked on an exploration to answer three pivotal questions that strategy gaming enthusiasts often ponder:

Question 1: “What are the most popular genres in the strategy games?”
Question 2: “Will users be more interested in newly launched game applications whenever there is one?”
Question 3: “Is a free mobile game application always more popular than a paid application, and if not, which holds greater appeal?”

But that's not all. Leveraging the structured database, I proceeded to craft a simple yet powerful web application using Express, Node.js, and Mustache. This application allows users to filter the data based on their preferences, empowering them to tailor their exploration of strategy gaming insights.
